- 👋 Hi, I’m @BKAmos
- 👀 I’m interested in computational biology. I have a BS in Medicinal and Agricultural Biotechnology, an MS in Biosystems and Agricultural Engineering, and a PhD in Integrated Plant and Soil Science with a focus on chemical and computational biology. In this repository I plan to host all of the code that I have written so that others can use and edit to adnvace their computational biology practice. I hope that these tools are beneficial to you and if you use them please cite the repository.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more python, machine learning, and how to process multiple types of biological data.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on computational biology applied to agriculture.
